We cook the broth from beef, add bay leaf and black pepper.
We cut the meat from the broth, sausages, sausage (or raw smoked sausage).
Finely chop the onions, cucumbers and parsley and simmer for 10 minutes with tomato paste.
We put the stew mixture in the broth and cook for no more than 10 minutes. 
Then add meat, sausages and sausage. Cook until the broth boils. 
Pour the olives into the hodgepodge along with the brine (the olives should be pitted).
 Bring to a boil and turn off immediately. Serve with a slice of lemon and sour cream.
